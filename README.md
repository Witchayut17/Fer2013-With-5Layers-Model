This project presents a machine learning–based spam email detection system using classical Natural Language Processing techniques.<br><br>
The system applies Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for text feature extraction and Logistic Regression for binary classification.<br><br>
By addressing class imbalance through weighted loss adjustment and decision threshold optimization, the proposed approach achieves effective spam detection performance while maintaining computational efficiency.
